# 🌟 Uffy — Learn English Through Playful Stories

**Uffy** is a mobile app for learning English, primarily designed for children aged 4 to 10. In the future, we plan to expand the platform to support other languages as well.


## 📖 Description

### What it's intended to do:
Uffy helps children learn English step by step in a fun and engaging way. The main story centers around a friendly alien who arrives on Earth without knowing any English. A child becomes the alien’s companion and learns the language alongside him. This shared learning journey creates emotional involvement and encourages consistent use of the app.


## ✨ Features and Specifications

- **Story-based learning**  
  Children follow the alien’s adventures through illustrated, age-appropriate visual stories. While the narrative is linear (no choices), it includes (or will include) learning activities within the stories.

- **Built-in word support**  
  New English words are introduced in context and can be tapped to hear pronunciation, see translations, and view helpful images.

- **Interactive mini-games** *(Realization in progress)*  
  Stories include educational games such as drag-and-drop vocabulary tasks, matching games, spelling puzzles, and sentence building challenges.

- **Gamification**  
  Children can customize the alien and other friendly characters by earning clothes, accessories, and decorations through learning activities.

- **Rewards**  
  Small prizes boost motivation and make learning fun.

- **Cross-platform**  
  Available on Android and iOS devices.


## 🚀 How it works

After downloading the app, a parent creates an account and sets up a child profile. The child is then introduced to the alien and begins exploring English through interactive stories and games. As children progress, they unlock new features and outfits. Learning happens naturally through reading and play — without pressure, but with constant encouragement and rewards.

## 🛠 Technical Description — Frontend

### Tools & Technologies

- **React Native**  
  JavaScript framework for building native mobile apps using a single codebase for Android and iOS.

- **Expo**  
  A platform that simplifies building, testing, and deploying React Native apps. Used for rapid development and real-time testing via Expo Go.

- **TypeScript**  
  Provides type safety and improves developer experience. Reduces runtime errors and makes the codebase more maintainable.

### Development Approach

The frontend is structured modularly to handle key features like:
- User authentication
- Home page
- Vocabulary explorer
- Story-based learning
- Wardrobe and customization

By using Expo and React Native:
- We ensured fast development and smooth cross-platform deployment.
- Teams could work on UI and functionality in parallel.
- The architecture supports scalability for adding more languages and features in the future.

# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
